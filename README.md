This is a simple command-line banking system using a Python class. This program allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit, withdraw, and check their account balances. Here's a brief overview of this code:

1. It has  a `Bank_Account` class that contains methods for account management, including creating accounts, logging in, depositing, withdrawing, and checking balances.

2. The `main()` function is where the program starts. It initializes an instance of the `Bank_Account` class and creates a list of customer accounts with usernames, passwords, and initial balances.

3. In a loop, the program offers options for users to log in, create a new account, or exit. Depending on the option chosen, it performs various actions related to account management.

4. Users can log in, and if successful, they can perform deposit, withdrawal, and balance check operations within their accounts.

5. The program keeps running until the user chooses to exit.
